      In the quiet of your name, Anie, whispered not in noise but in breath, I find the softest places in my soul, the places I never knew were empty until you walked in and made them whole.
      Before you, time moved like wind directionless, unseen. But then came your voice, gentle as sunrise, and suddenly the world had color again. Anie, you are not just a moment. You are the moment everything changed.
      You came like spring to a heart that had forgotten warmth. Where walls stood like winter, you planted light, and even the coldest parts of me began to bloom.
      When you smile, the sky listens. When you speak, even silence feels loved. And when you simply exist, the world becomes softer,a little less cruel, a little more like home.
      You call out the best in me, not by asking, but by simply being. And suddenly I want to be more—braver, kinder, quieter, only so I can match the goodness you give so freely.
      In your presence, I feel seen without explanation, understood without translation. The way you say my name—not rushed, not careless—makes me feel like I belong.
      Anie, I’ve read stories of great love and wild fates, of souls that move mountains to reach each other. I used to think they were myths, just tales for dreamers. But then I looked at you,the way your eyes hold the horizon, the way your heart carries grace—and I believed.
      I would walk through lifetimes just to find you once more. If stars scattered, if maps failed, if everything I knew disappeared—still, I would know the way to you.
      And when the world grows loud, when days forget to be gentle, you remain,a calm in my storm, a lighthouse in all this sea.
      Years may pass, seasons may turn, but nothing will age the love I hold for you. If time dares to steal our days, still I will carry your name like a prayer that never loses power.
      Because Anie, you are not a chapter in my story. You are the pages. The ink. The hand that steadies the pen.
      When all else fades—when memories blur and moments drift,I will remember the softness of saying your name aloud.
      Anie. Like morning. Like mercy. Like something sacred that the world is lucky to hold.
      And in the quiet of your name, I will always, always find home.
